You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Because, you might regret it later in life.

        Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Nothing's coming to my mind. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.
        
        I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Yeah. You too. Uh, look me up when you get there."
